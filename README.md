### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I am a self taught Frontend Developer. my primary goal on any project is to create a nice and meaningful UX for real word users. I believes in failing fast and fixing fast. last but not least Console errors make me happy :D

I spend most of my time in making stuff using Html, Css and JS.

Currently looking forwards to contribute to open source projects to giving back to the community. I already created a local community of frontend developers around my city to build a nice base for developers to help each other.

failing fast and fixing fast and result over reasons is my main quality.
