I am skilled in a range of languages (HTML, SCSS, JavaScript), frameworks (Tailwind CSS, Bootstrap), CMS systems (HubSpot CMS), and libraries (jQuery). my primary goal on any project is to create a nice and meaningful UX for real word users. I believes in failing fast and fixing fast and last but not least Console errors make me happy :D
