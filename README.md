I am a self taught Frontend Developer. my primary goal on any project is to create a nice and meaningful UX for real word users.

I spend most of my time in making stuff using Html, Css and JS.

I am looking forwards to contribute to open source projects to giving back to the community. community is really great place to learn and gorw with other folks so I already created a local community of frontend developers around my city to build a nice base for developers to help each other.

failing fast and fixing fast and result over reasons is my main quality and last but not least console errors make me happy :D
